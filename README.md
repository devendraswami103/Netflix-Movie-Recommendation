## Getting Started with a Movie Recommendation System

### Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides an introductory guide to building a movie recommendation system. The notebook demonstrates various techniques and methodologies that can be used to create personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. 

### Contents

- **Introduction:** A brief overview of recommendation systems and their importance.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean, preprocess, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Building the Model:** Step-by-step instructions to build different types of recommendation systems, including:
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Hybrid Approaches
- **Evaluation:** Techniques to assess the performance of the recommendation models.
- **Conclusion:** Summary of findings and potential next steps for improvement.

### Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scikit-surprise
```

### Dataset

The notebook utilizes a sample dataset of movies and user ratings, which is either provided within the notebook or can be downloaded from popular datasets

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Movie-Recommender.git
   ```
2. **Open the Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open `getting_started_with_a_movie_recommendation_system.ipynb`.
3. **Run the Cells:** Follow the instructions within the notebook. Execute the code cells in sequential order to build and evaluate the recommendation system.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand the basics of recommendation systems.
- Learn how to preprocess and analyze data for recommendation systems.
- Build and compare different recommendation models.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the models using appropriate metrics.
